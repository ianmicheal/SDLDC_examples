/* This is a basic demonstration of how to set up and play audio with SDL on the
   Dreamcast. It isn't actually meant as an example of how to do things the
   right way, but rather as more of a regression test to make sure that SDL
   still works...
   That all said, it does show how to set up a very simple audio callback to
   generate sound. In the case of this example, a simple tone generated from a
   sine wave is what is played. Of course, more complex things are possible, but
   are left as an exercise for the reader. ;-)

  I did just that and used to write a callback function to play a wavfile thanks BlueCrab:)
